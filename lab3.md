## Researching Commands
I decided to research more command-line options for find. The first option I looked into was the `-type n` option. 'n' can be replaced with 'b', 'c', 'd', 'p', 'f', 'l', 's', and 'D'. For this example I'll just be using `-type d` because 'd' stands for directory and essentially the type option returns files of that type. So in these examples:

I first used the `find -type d` command to find all the possible directories in the skill-demo1-data directory.
